## Learning Outcomes

Through building Wishlister, I gained hands‚Äëon experience with:

- **Kotlin fundamentals:** data classes, null safety, ViewBinding, and Activity lifecycles  
- **RecyclerView & Adapters:** creating custom view holders, handling click events, and grid layouts  
- **UI/UX Design:** crafting custom drawables, gradient backgrounds, pill‚Äëshaped buttons, and responsive layouts  
- **Firebase Integration:** setting up Realtime Database listeners, writing and reading structured data, and basic Authentication flows  
- **Animations & Transitions:** implementing fade‚Äëin effects and visual polish for a more engaging user experience  
- **Debugging & Data Handling:** filtering out null or orphaned entries, handling async callbacks, and improving app stability.
